# Hookable

This is a simple Sinatra app to help troubleshoot GitHub webhooks. Similar to (requestb.in)(http://requestb.in),
I wrote this app to help demonstrate, test, and develop GitHub webhooks.

## How to launch

There will be a deploy to Heroku button soon. In the meantime, you can push this up to your Heroku
account and add a MongoHQ instance. That's all you need to run this.
